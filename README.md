# javascript-algorithms-datastructures-masterclass

This project was developed while I was working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass by Colt Steele on Udemy. I've used some of the core concepts and examples from the course as a foundation, but Iâ€™ve made several modifications and enhancements to tailor the code to my project goals.

If you're interested in the course, you can find more details here: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Course Link</a>

This repository contains solutions and explanations for JavaScript algorithms and data structures.

## Folder Overview

- **big-o-notation/**: Provides insights into Big O notation for different operations. Check the `README.md` in this folder for more information.
- **object-operations/**: Contains various operations and performance analyses for JavaScript objects. See the `README.md` in this folder for detailed explanations and examples.
- **array-operations/**: Contains important operations (accessElement, insertElementAt, deleteElement, pushElement, popElement, spliceArray, forEachElement, mapArray, reduceArray, sortArray, searchElement) for arrays along with performance analysis. See the `README.md` in this folder for more details.

Each folder's `README.md` contains detailed information about the implementations, usage, and performance analysis of the algorithms and data structures.
