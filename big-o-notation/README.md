## Big O Notation

In this folder, I've put together several examples to help demonstrate key time complexities used in algorithm analysis:

- **`O(1)`** – Constant Time: Operations that take the same amount of time, no matter the input size.
- **`O(n)`** – Linear Time: Where the runtime grows in direct proportion to the input size.
- **`O(n^2)`** – Quadratic Time: Examples of operations that scale with the square of the input size.
- **`O(log n)`** – Logarithmic Time: Algorithms that divide the input in each step, leading to more efficient performance with larger inputs.

Each file in the `big-o-notation` folder contains JavaScript code that illustrates these time complexity concepts in a practical way.
